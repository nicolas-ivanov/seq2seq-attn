Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
Why?
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
You got something on your mind?
You have my word. As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
She's not a...
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?
No
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
No.
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Great
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
You did what?
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God. It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom? Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan. Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
That I'm used to.
That girl -- I --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
You got him involved?
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What've you got for me?
Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
Patrick Verona Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
What's this?
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?
Does it matter?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey. Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can be "cool"? You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
I should do this.
Do what?
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You up for it?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No -- something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
My grandmother's .
What?
That ' s completely adorable!
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out! By -- the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
+++$+++ Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
+++$+++ Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
What?
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
That's where we can help you. With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
I missed you.
+++$+++ It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
+++$+++ I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
+++$+++ Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
+++$+++ You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
+++$+++ You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home. Let her go.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
He's the devil's child...
We should have seen land.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ... Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey. I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
The Judgment is ours!
He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I could be gone for years.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They took everything...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What is it, now? Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
How far from here?
I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
What are you listening to?
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
No?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What...? Do I have so many already?
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Say not here! Cuba!
What is it? A tribe? An island?
You come! You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
Thousands.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Colon!
All of them! Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men!
If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...
My son, my son... Your certitudes are sometimes frightening... Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh? So you are a new man?
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
May I speak freely?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Do they have such thoughts?
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
We don't need to know.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
What do you read?
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Where can I meet this man?
You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
The land is there. I know it!
You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Oh no! No! Shit!
Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for?
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
You bring the cigarettes?
...delusions and paranoia.
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here. Shit...
Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights? Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut? How much?
I would say...half. Half is fair.
No. No way.
But it's...
Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don't try to negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.
Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I'm abused. Don't you think?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
Divorced.
I can't take you to my place.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
I know.
You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
What are you doing?
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.
Oh yeah...? Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
No! Nothing happened.
Chief - mind if I take her?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King!
What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield.
But Chief? Over this??
Don't you guys understand? It's all about image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Yeah, right.
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera. Don't look - put her in the car. Stay this side.
Are you hit?
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Who's there?
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
What's wrong?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Yeah. He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...? Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
What are you saying?
He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here.
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin' to do.
You know what that is, right?
No, what is it?
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
I'll come with you.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll let you know what happens.
This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come.
Two heads.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
You thirsty?
I'm on duty.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Of course.
Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Why not?
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Hey. I'm a professional.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
What do you want?
Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...
That was good. You were holding the evidence.
You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
You're ruthless.
Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
Could be Leon's.
Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it.
Answer the phone.
No. Tell me what you want to say.
Answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight!
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Okay. That is great. But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great.
No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk.
Promise?
I promise. We'll talk. You'll be great. You'll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Okay, til tonight.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah. I promise.
Okay. And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah. Good thing.
Okay.
See you later. Good luck.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go. I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
How old are your kids?
So what's unique?
He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
That's unique.
I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me.
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay. You ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
+++$+++ Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that. And what kind of work do you do?
I am butcher.
+++$+++ You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
You stuff sausage in it.
+++$+++ And what do you do with the bones?
+++$+++ Are you married?
Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars.
What? It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show. And they will show it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
You can't kill me. You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go! Let her go!!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Where's Czech girl?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment. I don't meet the other girls. Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Where is escort service?
That's confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address?
Listen to me. I don't want sex. Just give me the address and then you go.
Give me the address!!
+++$+++ Next. Could I see your documents, please?
+++$+++ What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
+++$+++ How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
+++$+++ Is he with you? Are you travelling together?
Yes.
+++$+++ Please join us. Come on forward.
Is there a problem?
We are both from Prague.
+++$+++ How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
+++$+++ I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Who is he?
This all you want?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies!
Don't speak Russian!
Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
Turn that off! Get the bags.
Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Gotta light the scene better. Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Shut up.
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
What is it?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? Oh - I got it. Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice. We come out free, rich and famous!
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I'm serious.
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' And 'action!'
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Because I am the director. Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit.
Credit?
Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You got that?
No, I don't get that!
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Did you hurt her?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg! Look. It wasn't my fault you two were caught. It's his fault. Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?! I wasn't going to wait!!!
We spent it!
Ha. Ha.
I can get you a job.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
Robert...?
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy! I can't talk business. Hang up. Have a drink. Get her a whiskey.
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
Yeah?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend!
I know.
What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Well, he...
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright. Go ahead.
That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
I speak English.
+++$+++ Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
New York.
+++$+++ Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
+++$+++ What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
+++$+++ Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
No. Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
I'll take him.
No way! He's mine!
We're takin' him. Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
I'll send a cop back for you.
You okay?
A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah, I'm religious. I'm not an Atheist like you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah? What kind?
Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.
He knew all along.
What??
What?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Yeah?
-- From Czechoslovakia? And how long have they been livin' in your building? Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'. Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don't know who your girl is.
How long they been livin' here?
You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Aren't you tired?
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
What are you gonna do?
Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
+++$+++ This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
+++$+++ Your doctor?
+++$+++ Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
+++$+++ ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
+++$+++ It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of. How could I know. I'm not a doctor.

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
It's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
How?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Well, that's something.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Hal?
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
What is it, Hal?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.

I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Certainly.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Thank you.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Five by five, Frank.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Yeah?
Name?
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
Yeah, dummy. Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it. I never paid for it in my life.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust. You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
What's the matter with my place?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
Here you go, baby.
Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun.
How about it?
I hear you've got visitors.
Would you guys...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Yeah. Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
No chance.
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done. End of story.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Ganz is in jail. He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out. I got to be on the street. Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way. Take off the bracelets or no deal.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie? There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead. And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim. And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here. If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye. And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
Sure. Then we had a fight this morning.
Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
What are you talkin' about?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
You made that move, huh?
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Let's go.
This sucks. A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You? Don't make me laugh. You can't take care of shit. You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt. All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
Just tell me about the money.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
He's after your money.
We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the money?
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Where's the goddamn car?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He's too chickenshit.
What?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
What about Luther?
We missed.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign. He's trading his girl for the money. All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Tell me something. Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah, I see her.
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it.
It's late, they're closing...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Do I get to kiss her too?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit? I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
You okay?
Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Wait a minute, Cates. I've been waitin' three years for that. I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
It's your money. It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I want it back.
Yeah...
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay. You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine. Nail this guy and make us all look good. But you better watch your ass. If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
What a screw-up.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
I didn't have the time.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
+++$+++ That's what you say, Cates...
Yeah.
+++$+++ But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
+++$+++ Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure? Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Billy Bear...
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. Can we find them?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
You look awful.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet? No calls?
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot. That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
I think I met her. Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
What am I wanted for?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
I'm all wet.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch. I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
What do you want to know? What difference does it make? I'm the guy in your bed the last three months. I make you feel good. You make me feel good. What the hell else do you want from a guy?
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Jack, are you okay?
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit? I'll tell you about bullshit. My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it. It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility. I like to get the job done right. And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right. I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him. Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Just one. Some lady called. Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't. We've had a hard night.
I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
You real down?
Nothing. No sign of Ganz. No sign of the Indian. Airport's clean. Train station. Bus station. Docks... Shit...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Whaddya think?
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Usual bullshit. You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Three more hours...
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years. And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Hey...
Shut up.
What do you want? What's goin' on?
Stall.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
Surprise, Luther.
Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her. I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
You sure?
How about some ammo?
How much?
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five. On credit.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Give it back.
Fuck you. You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
What're you laughing about?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Ikset-kiba. Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why? What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...would you like a drink?
No thank you.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. So full of..life!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
He's a she!
You noticed...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it! This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
So you do know her.
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
It means, "Never without my permission".
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
What are you doing?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
And then?
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop? You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
What is?
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
They really made her...
I got it! Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Who?
Leeloo... is... she's...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
At least, the cat comes back.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
I don't need one.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
Hello?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
So, just how big was this fare?
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.

...Priest...
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
...What's your name?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Hello?
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
30 seconds...
6... 5...
...Hi.
+++$+++ ...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates. And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
+++$+++ My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
+++$+++ Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't think this is a good time...
+++$+++ ...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Six to the left. One to the right.
+++$+++ He's on vacation.
+++$+++ Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
+++$+++ Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
+++$+++ You know how to fly this thing?
+++$+++ I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
What did you say? What did you do?
+++$+++ Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Is that all?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
What mission?
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Just one... why me?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
And the third one?
Don't you open your messages?
I've had enough good news for today
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
...Shit!
It's my wife.
I thought you were divorced.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Apipoulai!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Dinoine chagantakat!
Apipoulai!
Love...
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
Here we go again...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
It's up to you now, Angel!
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...Like love...
Exactly.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
Not going to open?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The last two messages I got? The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
At least I won lunch.
The cash man!
Been here long?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Uh..
It's not?
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
This thing solid?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert, do you read me?
Is that better?
Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Got it.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Welcome home.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Smoking? I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing? Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
How's the detective business?
Business was fine. I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Sure. I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?
This is the mortgage. This is Cindy's college money.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot. I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back. We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
Hello?
Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..
Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong? Are you alright?
I'm okay. Please, honey, I can't explain. Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out. I'm on my way. I'll be back at the house in three hours. Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom? What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me...
Tom...
Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know. I'm sorry...
You owe me an explanation. You can't treat me like this.
I wanted to call. I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Look where we are. Look at yourself. You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
Don't...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got. She's the only witness.
She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in the paper...
What are these?
Anything harder?
+++$+++ There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
+++$+++ What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What are you talking about?
The loop! The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?! This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible. Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt. Think about it. There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything. I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Dino...
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.
I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.
+++$+++ Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
+++$+++ You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
+++$+++ Is it?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course. Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
+++$+++ And they are?
I want to watch you work.
+++$+++ I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
+++$+++ Machine.
+++$+++ He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
We can do that.
+++$+++ You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.
+++$+++ What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
+++$+++ You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
+++$+++ I'll do this for you. Fifteen thousand dollars.
Machine's in?
Where's that?
+++$+++ You brought the money?
+++$+++ Excellent.
Where are the women?
What are these for?
+++$+++ Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
+++$+++ Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What are you... ?
+++$+++ Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Look, I don't know what this...
+++$+++ You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
+++$+++ Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
+++$+++ Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Is that him?
+++$+++ Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
You're a dead man.
+++$+++ Leave him alone.
... sorry...
You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone. Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself... That's the last they saw her. The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch... They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved. They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
I'm not so sure about this.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance. We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Any good?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days. I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Celebrity Films.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago...
What the fuck are you.. ?
What's he talking about?
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Okay, we'll come back to that. So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it. It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine. And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models. And she never walked out.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Why?
I don't know. I felt like it. I never saw anyone get done before.
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that. It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around. This place was a shit-hole. I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries. Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Keep moving.
You can't go to the cops. All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know... ... out there somewhere.
Where? Show me where.
Do it.
Don't think I won't.
Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it." Almost makes you worse.
You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.
+++$+++ I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month. Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
+++$+++ The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
+++$+++ Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head. Till then, fuck you.
Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
I'm listening.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Of what sort?
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy. And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film. That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust. Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything. Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
I was well compensated.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe. How'd you find me?
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone. If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago. A girl no one even remembers.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one. Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
You're making me very angry.
Just tell me. Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really? What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're asking me why?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Truman Capote.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on... You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
I need some information. Thought you might be able to help.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
How long you been working there?
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max. This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
There's not much illegal.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know. I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great. If not, speak now.
You're not a cop, are you? If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye. Like Shaft.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
How much do you make now?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
... Hello... ?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc. Nobody even considers them pornography anymore. Then, there's mainstream hardcore. Triple X. The difference is penetration. That's hardcore. That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are. They pump out 150 videos a week. A week. They've even got a porno Academy Awards. America loves pornography. Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying. Somebody's buying those videos. Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex. Know what else? It's only gonna get worse. More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution. Desensitization. Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive! Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out. Know what I mean? For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while. They have to be the biggest tits ever. Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally. Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Interesting theory.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend. We're talking about stuff where people get hurt. Specialty product.
Child pornography.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal. This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line. How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not? Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn. Rape films, but there aren't many. I've never seen one.
Snuff films.
I heard you asking. That guy wasn't yanking you around. There's no such thing.
What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see?
How old are you?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Yeah, I'm a real genius. What choices have I got? Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it. I work a job. It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb. So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver? Go to Harvard? Run for President? What about you, pops?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids?
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish.
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look. He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline. Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Well, I'm in New York now. What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I'll call back.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Wha... ?
Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's this?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
+++$+++ Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
+++$+++ Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
He's odd.
+++$+++ I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
+++$+++ As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.
My condolences.
+++$+++ His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
+++$+++ Mostly. That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.
He succeeded.
+++$+++ Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.
+++$+++ My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.
You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
+++$+++ There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents. I felt these were my husband's private things. I didn't... I didn't realize...
Do you want to tell me what you found?
+++$+++ It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I'm afraid I don't...
+++$+++ I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police...
Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
+++$+++ No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
+++$+++ I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.
+++$+++ Will you watch it and see for yourself?
You... you need to go to the police.
+++$+++ I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
+++$+++ No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations...
+++$+++ You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay...
+++$+++ My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
+++$+++ One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Okay, I follow you so far...
+++$+++ Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're joking.
+++$+++ Hello... ?
I'm here.
+++$+++ Do you think the film could have cost that much?
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations. Who knows? It sure could have. I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
+++$+++ Okay.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself?
+++$+++ You told me to look, so I looked.
+++$+++ Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
+++$+++ How are you? Having any luck?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
+++$+++ I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
+++$+++ Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
I've made progress. I'm in Manhattan. Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
+++$+++ How will I get it to you?
+++$+++ Yes... ?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
+++$+++ I don't understand, who are... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
+++$+++ Yes, but...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
+++$+++ Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
+++$+++ No.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations. It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts. All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
+++$+++ They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
+++$+++ I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
+++$+++ No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
+++$+++ She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
+++$+++ I don't know.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide?
+++$+++ Yes.
September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.
+++$+++ We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Why do you think he did it?
+++$+++ It got to be too much for him.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
+++$+++ There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
+++$+++ You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask. I apologize.
+++$+++ People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time. Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow...
+++$+++ Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother. Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. That's when you start going to church.
We're all like that.
+++$+++ Are you religious?
No.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
+++$+++ What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
+++$+++ There wasn't one. The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
+++$+++ I don't know. I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something...
+++$+++ No. You don't have any reason to think that...
+++$+++ How... how can you say that to me...?
Will you let me look?
+++$+++ My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
You were right. I didn't find anything. I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
+++$+++ I think about it everyday. But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
It's been six years.
+++$+++ Hello... ?
Mrs. Mathews? It's Thomas. Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
+++$+++ I remember. You just left...
+++$+++ What are you talking about... ?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
+++$+++ Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
+++$+++ Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
+++$+++ No...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
+++$+++ No... no... no...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
+++$+++ Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yes... I remember Mary
You... you do? You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Do you know what happened to her?
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet. Oh, I adored her. I supposed I always hoped she'd be back. After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things. Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night. The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman. It's unpleasant, I know. I apologize...
None too discreet, is he?
No, sir, he is not.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Yeah, I know the spiel. If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
What?
The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah. She'd be half as strict as you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Rick...I can't.
Alice, you think you can leave?
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
You alright?
I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one?
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison? This looks like Sheila's.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
Figure it out?!?! I'll be insane before I figure it out. The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep. Not while he's using me.
Here you are. Where were you this morning? Rick's looking all over for you.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid! God, I can't find them. I can't find them anywhere.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
Sounds like a game show host to me.
No really, it's a fable. The 'guardian of good' dreams. It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You what?
Kristen, what happened?
You in a hurry?
I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.
I know. I hardly have any time to study.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much. You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
No...
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan.
I thought it was an accident. Smoking in bed.
I was there in the dream. He took her. It was awful. It was awful...
No, don't! I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
Extra money, huh?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Not really.
Is there something we can do?
You don't really get it. He's not a nightstalker. It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack? She was gonna be a doctor.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey, Rick!
I don't get it.
So what's up? What'd I miss?
She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
How she doing? I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila. I know how it feels. I've been thinking about Kristen. Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
About Freddy?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
What's wrong with me?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I'll tell you later.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's okay, babe. We're with you.
Feeling better now?
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
You just stay put. You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
+++$+++ Excuse us, dear.
+++$+++ Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.
+++$+++ In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
+++$+++ We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be. Maybe we should go find your Mom.
She doesn't want me around
No you're not. You don't even care about being a mom. How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
Mommy...?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus! Don't do that!
The tickets.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris. It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Okay, babe. What's the matter?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
About him?
You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.
Yeah...I guess.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
You're right.
There you go. Love you.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
+++$+++ I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Dad!
+++$+++ Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
+++$+++ You sure you don't want a ride to work?
+++$+++ I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
+++$+++ Sobering...
Very funny.
+++$+++ Alice...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
+++$+++ Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
+++$+++ Alice!
I've got to go.
+++$+++ No! I won't have you running around in the middle of the night. You're coming home.
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.
It was no accident. It was Krueger. He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore. He's found some other way.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident. Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
Oh, Alice...no. Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you. But, you're like a locked safe. You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman. Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And...
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
My baby!
Whoa, slow down. How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Where are you going?
I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob. You said she committed suicide?
That's what the newspapers thought. She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
But I've seen her grave.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life. Oh, what's that?
Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Who?
Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild... What do you think?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do. I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Yeah...
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Look. Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard. He was bitching about it at the party last night. He was under pressure. We all are.
Bottom line, Alice. Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.
Vomit?
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta. A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
It's okay.
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.' I thought it was your father.
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.
You could train someone else.
What is it?
Your 'out.' This came for you.
My father! He's not - ?
What did you mean: I'm 'out?'
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you? Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>! It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps. But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit! Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway. I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward! And it happens you've got no choice: Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars. But now - I wonder -
Yes?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But if they <u>do</u>?
I don't know.
I wouldn't worry. So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating - What do you think of this husband of yours? On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer. But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work. She deserves a fighting chance!
Reef!
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home. Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Huh?
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
I guess.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive. A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two. He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist. A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot! 'Ban the atom tests! Junk the nuclear subs! Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son! It broke his heart. Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy. Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Cyclops?
We're stuck tight!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
'Us?'
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
What's more important - there's our problem. The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I think you're right.
Yeah?
I don't hear anything. Maybe you've been down here too long. Why don't you go back up and -
Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Somewhere down there?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
Dave - !
Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Course and speed?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What course, Skipper?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
Excuse me, Skipper---
Yes, Griff?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
We read you! Go ahead, Doctor! They're inside the saucer. It's filled with breathable air!
Wonderful!
Now they feel it...down below.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
+++$+++ Under <u>water</u>?
+++$+++ ...above Murmansk, and Finland.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear. But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
+++$+++ <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force. Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
+++$+++ ....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it.... ...'recharging his batteries'?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
+++$+++ As we near the Pole...
There's got to be an explanation!
+++$+++ All ready?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I did go. Just back. Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent. My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef - You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Who with?
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?
Huh?
What do you think?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
It's the screws, Skipper. At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
What?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
+++$+++ Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
That's a <u>face</u>???
+++$+++ Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
+++$+++ My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
He did!
Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
+++$+++ On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?
+++$+++ It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
+++$+++ Obviously.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
See what?
Well, I'll be - !
+++$+++ Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer. 'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops? Then that's <u>our</u> course! Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
+++$+++ We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north. At five knots...no, six!
+++$+++ Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
What are you boys up to?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
You see it?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
He's on to us!
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
They said.
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
